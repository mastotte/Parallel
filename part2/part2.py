# Create a loop that is semantically equivalent to the reference loop.
# That is, it computes  a[0] = a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] ... + a[size]
# where size is passed in by the main source string.
#
# You should unroll by a factor of "partitions". This is done logically
# by splitting a into N partitions (where N == partitions). You will compute
# N reductions, one computation for each partition per loop iteration.
#
# You will need a cleanup loop after the main loop to combine
# the values in each partition.
#
# You can assume the size and the number of partitions will be
# a power of 2, which should make the partitioning logic simpler.
#
# You can gain confidence in your solution by running the code with
# several power-of-2 unroll factors, e.g. 2,4,8,16. You can assume
# partition is less than size.
