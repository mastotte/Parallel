Design Document for Homework 2

Part 1-------------

Function: filter.h

Explanation: Implement Petersen's filter lock.
n-1 levels to pass through to get to the critical section, where the number of threads is n. 
Only 1 thread allowed in the critical section, 2 in the section above it, 3 above that and so on.

Implementation:

Each time a thread arrives at a level it will become the victim of the level. 

while ( There are no threads in higher levels AND I am the victim of this level )
    spin and do nothing
    


Part 2--------------

The Fair Reader-Writer lock that I am going to try to implement is a lock that works like so:
Writers will fight over control of the mutex, while readers are allowed to read whenever a 
writer does not have control of the mutex. Writers set 'writerFlag' to 1 to signal that they 
are in control of the mutex.
